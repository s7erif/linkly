CardAI Creator is a highly optimized SaaS application designed to help professionals, creators, and teams build interactive digital business cards. It features a modern layout designer, real-time preview, QR code sharing, a visual cards dashboard, and a floating AI chatbot widget that lets visitors ask questions to a digital clone of the card owner.

**Why use CardAI Creator?**

- **Production-Ready SaaS Boilerplate** — Configured with Google OAuth, PostgreSQL connection pooling, and Stripe Checkout.
- **AI Custom Layouts** — Enter prompts like *"make this look retro cyberpunk"* to generate custom Tailwind card styling using OpenAI models via MuAPI.
- **Interactive AI Clone Assistant** — Shared cards feature a chatbot widget. Visitors can ask questions (e.g. *"What is her email?"*, *"What are his core specialties?"*), resolved using the card's profile as LLM context.
- **Base64 & MuAPI Image Uploading** — Self-contained image selector uploads avatars to MuAPI with automatic inline data-URL fallback.
- **7 Premium Pre-designed Styles** — Neumorphism, Cyberpunk Glitch, Holographic Glassmorphism, Interactive 3D Tilt, Swiss International Style, Classic Minimal, and Brutalist Marquee templates load instantly offline.
- **Automatic QR Codes** — Standard QR code generator overlay points directly to the card's public URL for quick mobile scanning.
- **Split Save Protections** — When editing an existing card, users can either **"Save Changes"** (update current) or **"Save as New Copy"** (clone to new ID), preventing accidental overwrites.

### 🤖 Visitor AI Clone Chatbot
- Visitors viewing the public `/card/[hash]` page can open a floating chat drawer.
- Answers questions about your experience, contact info, and website by referencing profile details.
- Runs a synchronous backend polling script so that visitors get instant, snappy answers.

- A dedicated dashboard where users can see all their saved cards in a clean, visual grid of previews.
- Quick actions: **Edit** (opens in workspace), **View** (opens public page), **Delete** (with confirmation), **Copy Link**, and **Show/Download QR Code**.

### 📱 Responsive Previews
- Left sidebar for form parameters editing.
- Center/Right live viewport displaying updates in real-time inside a mobile device mock iframe to prevent styles leaking.
